  summary:
    - The PIPE-TRADES-CLI project has delivered a fully functional proof of concept.
    - The CLI is operational on Codespaces, Kali Linux, and Alpine/iSH.
    - All core features (beam calculation, GPS decode, rolling offset) are verified.
    - The project is containerized with Docker and includes Kubernetes manifests.
    - Public GitHub repository is live and up to date.
    - Install scripts for bash and PowerShell are provided.
    - Recon YAML and ML sandbox scaffolds are in place for future expansion.

  decision:
    - The board acknowledges successful delivery of the proof of concept.
    - Approves moving to the next phase: Recon Engine and ML Sandbox development.
    - Recommends continued open-source development and documentation.
